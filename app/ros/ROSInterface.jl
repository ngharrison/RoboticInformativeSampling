A struct that stores information for communicating with Swagbot.

Objects of this type can be used as samplers in missions, meaning they can be
called with a MQSampleInput to return its value. This object also has a length,
which is the length of the number of its subscriptions and can be iterated over
to get the name of each one.

Creating a $(FUNCTIONNAME) object requires a vector of topics to subscribe to
for measurement data, essentially the list of sensors onboard the robot to
listen to. Each element of this list should be a 2-tuple of topics that will
transmit the value and error for each sensor. This constructor initializes a ROS
node and sets up a publisher to pub_topic.

```julia
function (R::ROSSampler{String})(new_loc::Location)
```

Returns a vector of values from the sample location, one for each sensor
measurement available. It does this by first publishing the next location to
sample. Once the location is sampled, it calls out to each topic in sequence and
waits for its message.

# Examples
```julia
data_topics = [
    "/value1",
    "/value2"
]

done_topic = "sortie_finished"
pub_topic = "latest_sample"

sampler = ROSSampler(data_topics, done_topic, pub_topic)

location = [.1, .3]
[value1, value2] = sampler(location)

```julia
function (R::ROSSampler{NTuple{2, String}})(new_loc::Location)
```

Returns a vector of (value, error) pairs from the sample location, one for each
sensor measurement available. It does this by first publishing the next location
to sample. Once the location is sampled, it calls out to each topic in sequence
and waits for its message.

# Examples
```julia
data_topics = [
    ("/value1", "/error1"),
    ("/value2", "/error2")
